Description: Compute pairwise Moran's I statistics and signed delta I signatures
    for spatial transcriptomics data. The signed delta I method computes
    distance-dependent spatial correlation curves to distinguish true responsive
    genes from constitutively expressed genes. Supports both bivariate (symmetric)
    and directional (I_ND) correlation modes for spot-based platforms (Visium), and
    cell-type-aware I_ND computation for single-cell resolution platforms (CosMx,
    Xenium, MERFISH). Uses optimized BLAS matrix operations via RcppArmadillo for
    high performance. Includes utilities for loading 10x Visium data and VST
    normalization.
