\title{Filter Senders by Expression (Within Cell Type)}
\usage{
filter_high_expression(expr, quantile_prob = 0.25)
}
\arguments{
\item{expr}{Expression vector (for cells of sender type)}

\item{quantile_prob}{Quantile threshold (default: 0.25 = keep top 75 percent)}
}
\value{
List with high_expr_idx (relative to input), threshold, n_high
}
\description{
Apply expression quantile filter to keep high-expression cells.
Matches Python: keep cells with expr > quantile(expr, quantile_prob)
}
