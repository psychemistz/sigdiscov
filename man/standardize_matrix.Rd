\title{Standardize Matrix (Gene-wise)}
\usage{
standardize_matrix(X)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Numeric matrix (genes x observations).}
}
\value{
Gene-wise standardized matrix with same dimensions.
}
\description{
Standardizes each row (gene) of a matrix to have mean 0 and sd 1.
}
\details{
Each row is standardized independently. This is the standard
preprocessing for spatial correlation analysis.
}
\examples{
X <- matrix(rnorm(100), 10, 10)
X_norm <- standardize_matrix(X)
rowMeans(X_norm)  # All approximately 0
apply(X_norm, 1, sd)  # All approximately 1

}
