\title{Standardize Expression Matrix (Z-score)}
\usage{
standardize_matrix(X)

standardize_matrix(X)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{Numeric matrix (genes x observations).}

\item{expr}{Expression matrix (genes x cells/spots). Can be raw or normalized.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Print progress messages (default: FALSE).}
}
\value{
Standardized matrix with same dimensions.

Gene-wise standardized matrix with same dimensions.
}
\description{
Gene-wise z-score normalization. Each gene is standardized to have
mean = 0 and sd = 1 across cells/spots.

Standardizes each row (gene) of a matrix to have mean 0 and sd 1.
}
\details{
This function is automatically called internally before computing spatial
metrics (Moran's I, I_ND). You typically don't need to call it directly.

Formula: \eqn{z_{ij} = (x_{ij} - \bar{x}_i) / \sigma_i}

Genes with zero variance (constant expression) are set to zero.

Each row is standardized independently. This is the standard
preprocessing for spatial correlation analysis.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Standardize normalized data
expr_z <- standardize_matrix(norm_data)
}

X <- matrix(rnorm(100), 10, 10)
X_norm <- standardize_matrix(X)
rowMeans(X_norm)  # All approximately 0
apply(X_norm, 1, sd)  # All approximately 1

}
