\title{Create Sparse Weight Matrix from Pre-computed Neighbors}
\usage{
create_weights_from_neighbors_cpp(
  nn_idx,
  nn_dist,
  sigma,
  radius = -1,
  row_normalize = TRUE,
  self_weight = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{nn_idx}{Neighbor index matrix (n x k) from RANN::nn2, 1-indexed}

\item{nn_dist}{Neighbor distance matrix (n x k) from RANN::nn2}

\item{sigma}{Gaussian sigma for weight computation}

\item{radius}{Maximum distance cutoff (neighbors beyond this are ignored)}

\item{row_normalize}{Whether to row-normalize weights (default: TRUE)}

\item{self_weight}{Weight for self-connections (default: 0, no self)}
}
\value{
List with sparse weight matrix W and weight_sum
}
\description{
Efficiently creates weight matrix from pre-computed neighbor indices
(e.g., from RANN k-NN search). Scales to millions of cells.
