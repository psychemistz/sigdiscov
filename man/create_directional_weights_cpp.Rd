\title{Create Directional Weight Matrix (Sender to Receiver)}
\usage{
create_directional_weights_cpp(sender_coords, receiver_coords, radius)
}
\arguments{
\item{sender_coords}{Sender spot coordinates (n_s x 2)}

\item{receiver_coords}{Receiver spot coordinates (n_r x 2)}

\item{radius}{Distance threshold}
}
\value{
Sparse weight matrix (n_senders x n_receivers), row-normalized
}
\description{
Computes a weight matrix for directional analysis where senders and
receivers are different sets of spots. Used for expression-based
sender/receiver splitting in Visium analysis.
}
\details{
For directional mode, the weight matrix is not square. Each sender spot
gets connections to receiver spots within the radius, with row normalization
so that weights sum to 1 per sender.
}
