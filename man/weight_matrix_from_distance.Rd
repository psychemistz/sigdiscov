\title{Create Weight Matrix from Distance Matrix}
\usage{
weight_matrix_from_distance(
  dist_matrix,
  sigma = 100,
  max_dist = Inf,
  self_weight = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dist_matrix}{Distance matrix (spots x spots).}

\item{sigma}{RBF kernel bandwidth. Default: 100.}

\item{max_dist}{Maximum distance to include. Weights for larger distances
are set to zero. Default: Inf (no cutoff).}

\item{self_weight}{Weight for self-connections (diagonal). Default: 0.}
}
\value{
Weight matrix with same dimensions as input.
}
\description{
Creates a spatial weight matrix from a pre-computed distance matrix
using RBF kernel.
