\title{Standardize a Vector}
\usage{
standardize(x, na.rm = TRUE)

standardize(x, na.rm = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector.}

\item{na.rm}{Logical. Remove NAs before computing mean/sd (default: TRUE).}
}
\value{
Standardized vector (mean = 0, sd = 1).

Standardized numeric vector.
}
\description{
Z-score standardization of a single vector.

Standardizes a numeric vector to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1.
}
\details{
Computes: \code{(x - mean(x)) / sd(x)}

A small constant (1e-10) is added to the denominator to avoid
division by zero for constant vectors.
}
\examples{
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
standardize(x)
# Returns approximately: -1.26, -0.63, 0, 0.63, 1.26
