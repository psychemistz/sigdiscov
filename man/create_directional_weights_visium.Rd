\title{Create Directional Weight Matrix (Sender to Receiver)}
\usage{
create_directional_weights_visium(sender_coords, receiver_coords, radius)
}
\arguments{
\item{sender_coords}{Numeric matrix. Sender spot coordinates (n_s x 2).}

\item{receiver_coords}{Numeric matrix. Receiver spot coordinates (n_r x 2).}

\item{radius}{Numeric. Distance threshold.}
}
\value{
Sparse weight matrix (n_senders x n_receivers), row-normalized.
}
\description{
Creates a weight matrix for directional analysis where senders and
receivers are different sets of spots.
}
\details{
For directional mode, the weight matrix is not square. Each sender spot
gets connections to receiver spots within the radius, with row normalization
so that weights sum to 1 per sender.

This is the key function for expression-based sender/receiver analysis
in Visium data.
}
\examples{
# Senders at top, receivers at bottom
sender_coords <- matrix(c(0, 500, 100, 500, 200, 500), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
receiver_coords <- matrix(c(0, 0, 100, 0, 200, 0), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
W <- create_directional_weights_visium(sender_coords, receiver_coords, radius = 600)
