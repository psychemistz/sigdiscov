\title{Create Ring Weight Matrix for Visium}
\usage{
create_ring_weights_visium(coords, inner_radius, outer_radius)
}
\arguments{
\item{coords}{Numeric matrix. Spot coordinates (n x 2).}

\item{inner_radius}{Numeric. Inner radius (exclusive).}

\item{outer_radius}{Numeric. Outer radius (inclusive).}
}
\value{
Sparse ring weight matrix (n x n), row-normalized.
}
\description{
Creates a weight matrix where only spots in an annulus (ring) between
inner and outer radii receive weight. Useful for excluding immediate
neighbors or analyzing specific distance bands.
}
\details{
Weight is assigned to spots where inner_radius < d(i,j) <= outer_radius.
This is useful for:
\itemize{
\item Analyzing paracrine signaling at specific distance ranges
\item Excluding immediate neighbors to focus on longer-range effects
\item Computing spatial correlation at multiple distance bands
}
}
\examples{
coords <- matrix(runif(200), 100, 2) * 1000
W_ring <- create_ring_weights_visium(coords, inner_radius = 100, outer_radius = 200)
