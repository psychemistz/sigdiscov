Title: Spatial Signature Discovery for Spatial Transcriptomics
Version: 1.4.0
Author: Seongyong Park [aut, cre]
Maintainer: Seongyong Park <psychemistz@gmail.com>
Description: Unified spatial signature discovery for spatial transcriptomics data.
    Supports both Visium (10x Genomics) and single-cell resolution platforms
    (CosMx, Xenium, MERFISH). Computes bivariate Moran's I, I_ND (normalized
    directional Moran's I), and signed Delta I to identify genes with spatially
    correlated expression patterns. Features include binary weights for Visium,
    Gaussian weights for single-cell data, batch computation for all cell type
    pairs, genome-wide spatial interaction analysis with annular (ring) weights,
    multi-quantile support, FDR correction, and Python-compatible HDF5 output.
    CPU-optimized for cross-platform compatibility.
